## DESCRIPTION
Simple Class that creates a "particles_cycle_finished" signal to eliminate needing to add timers to all of your particle nodes.  This is emitted when the your particles' lifetime expires and accounts for preprocessing and randomness.  Please report any bugs by opening an Issue on GitHub.

## TWO WAYS TO USE
1. Create a `Particles2D` node (or use an existing one), add a script, change `extends Particles2D` to `extends Particles2D_Plus`.
2. Click the built in "Create New Node" button (CMD+A) and search for the "Particles2D_Plus" node, add it to your scene as you would normally.
